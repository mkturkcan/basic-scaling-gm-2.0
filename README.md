# A Basic Full Screen Scaling
This is a minimal project for GM: Studio 2.0, showing a display resolution independent screen scaling setup. Shows how to set up zooming in and out and building a game without worrying about graphical glitches due to interpolation. This project does not show how to handle scaling for HTML5 targets.
